# Testing a Windows release candidate

Use a separate data folder and a copy of any existing guest. Keep the original
backup untouched. Follow [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md) for running a signed draft
candidate against locally served, authenticated assets.

## Help complete the v1 hardware matrix

The published baseline is [v0.0.19-preview](https://github.com/omacom/try-omarchy-windows/releases/tag/v0.0.19-preview).
The next candidate has not been published. Reports on v19 are useful, but must
not be recorded as acceptance of unreleased master changes. Maintainers should
pin one signed candidate and its launcher/runtime/guest hashes in
[issue #77](https://github.com/omacom/try-omarchy-windows/issues/77) before the
combined candidate round.

Most useful additional hosts: Intel or NVIDIA graphics, full Hyper-V enabled,
Core Ultra, Windows 10, and physical monitors with different scaling. The existing
AMD Windows 11 evidence is linked in [V1-READINESS.md](V1-READINESS.md).

For an initial report, record the details below and test boot, GPU/CPU rendering,
keyboard focus, clipboard, video/audio, shutdown and relaunch. If available, add
sleep/resume, mixed-DPI movement and headphone switching. Report only what you
actually tested; one host need not complete every checklist. Maintainers should
run destructive interruption tests only on disposable copies.

## Report details

Copy this into #77 or the relevant issue. Mark untested items as untested.

Use diagnostics from the tray or `TryOmarchy.exe -diagnostics` for failures.
Review the zip before attaching it; logs can contain local paths and other
personal details. Do not upload the guest disk or a full backup.

## Everyday use

- [ ] Fresh install at the default location and another local drive. Use the
  Windows folder picker for install location and sharing, including a long path.
- [ ] On a copied install, confirm that malformed preferences offer repair,
  declining leaves them unchanged, and accepting preserves the original file
  before restoring defaults without changing guest files.
- [ ] Cancel a download, relaunch, and finish setup without a broken install.
- [ ] Instant account and personalized account both reach the desktop.
- [ ] GPU rendering, then CPU fallback, both reach the desktop.
- [ ] Keyboard and Windows key work only in the intended window; host shortcuts
  still work after switching away. Windows handles Win+L itself.
- [ ] Text clipboard works in both directions, including Unicode, trailing
  newlines, copying an earlier value again, and reconnecting after a guest reboot.
- [ ] Shared files can be read and written from both sides.
- [ ] File/folder clipboard and transfer windows work in both directions with
  Unicode names, empty directories and matching file hashes; originals remain intact.
- [ ] Audio playback, device switching, and video work. Note microphone activity
  at idle and when an app starts and stops recording.
- [ ] Resize, fullscreen, and movement between monitors with different scaling.
- [ ] Guest reboot, poweroff, relaunch, Windows sleep, and resume.
- [ ] At least one hour of use without the launcher exiting or input forwarding
  stopping. Report idle CPU after five minutes without animation.
- [ ] RDP and VNC sessions, including Ctrl+Alt+G as the input fallback.
- [ ] Image clipboard: a Windows screenshot pastes into an Omarchy app, and an
  image copied in Omarchy pastes into a Windows app. Text keeps working after.
- [ ] The guest clock matches Windows after a sleep and resume, and the desktop
  keyboard layout and time zone match the Windows ones on a non-US machine,
  including AltGr and dead keys.
- [ ] Close the VM window at a moved, non-maximized size; the next launch opens
  it there. Unplug the monitor it was on; the next launch opens maximized.
- [ ] `TryOmarchy.exe -reclaim` after deleting a large file in Omarchy;
  after shutdown the disk file is smaller and Windows free space never fell
  below 4 GiB during the pass. Repeat with Settings showing the new size.
- [ ] Settings: Rendering set to CPU and back to Automatic takes effect on the
  next launch; Guest CPUs shows the automatic choice for this PC.
- [ ] Remove Try Omarchy from Apps & features on a copied install; the folder,
  its shortcuts, and its entry are gone and the original install still runs.

## Hardware matrix facts to record

The nested test VM cannot answer these; every physical report should.

- GPU vendor, driver version, and whether the desktop came up on GPU or CPU
  rendering (`render-probe.json` in the data folder records the result).
- Idle CPU of `qemu-system-x86_64w.exe` in Task Manager five minutes after the
  desktop settles, with and without a video playing.
- Whether the Windows microphone indicator lights at launch before any app
  records, and whether it lights when one does.
- Display scaling in use, and whether text in Omarchy is crisp at 125 percent
  and above; whether moving the window between monitors with different
  scaling leaves it usable.
- Whether audio follows a headphone plug-in mid-session.
- Whether the guest browses with the machine's VPN connected.

## Data and update recovery

Create a few identifiable files before each test and compare them afterwards.
Use the copied guest for interruption and low-space tests.

- [ ] A copied pre-transfer installation updates through its original signed
  feed into the Omacom candidate. Record starting and target versions, release
  URLs and redirects, signature verification, and preserved files. Force a
  rollback and confirm the copied installation still boots. Local candidate
  tests do not replace checking the public URLs after publication.
- [ ] An existing guest upgrades without replacing its OS, account, or files.
- [ ] Interrupt the first updated boot before readiness, then relaunch. Previous
  launcher and payloads return and the existing files remain readable.
- [ ] A preview that misses the bridge installs the bridge first, then stable
  on its next update check. Test direct stable install and stable-to-stable too.
- [ ] Grow the disk, verify capacity inside Omarchy with `df -h /`, and check the
  files. Lowering the preference and rolling back the launcher never shrink it.
- [ ] From Settings, back up a stopped VM, cancel an operation, and restore a
  separate copy. Verify its Start Omarchy and Settings shortcuts point to that
  copy, then boot it and compare the guest files.
- [ ] Reset from Settings after taking a backup. Confirm first-run setup on the
  next launch and that the previous disk is retained under `vm/before-reset-*`.
  Check keyboard navigation, file pickers, progress, and scaling of the controls.
- [ ] Low host free space produces a useful error and leaves the existing guest
  usable after space is freed.
- [ ] Configuration export restores the selected theme, personal configuration,
  and added packages on a separate fresh Omarchy installation.

- [ ] In portable mode, reset with `-portable -fresh`, reach a new guest, and
  verify that `vm/before-reset-*` retains the previous QCOW2 disk and identity.
  With Omarchy closed and the matching original factory payload restored,
  returning that retained pair to `vm` should recover the previous guest.

## Installation moves

Use a disposable copy and the candidate launcher throughout. Record source and
destination filesystem, allocated size, logical disk capacity, elapsed time,
launcher hash, and guest/runtime hashes.

- [ ] Move default to another drive, custom to custom, and back to default.
  Include same-volume moves, Unicode/spaces, and long paths. Retain unrelated
  installation files and recovery folders; shared folders stay external.
- [ ] Start from Desktop, Start menu, a downloaded candidate, and explicit
  `-dir` pointing at the old location. Each must use the moved guest. Open
  Settings from the old executable, then clean up the previous location.
- [ ] Confirm logical capacity and file checksums, sparse allocation, timestamps,
  Apps & features registration, and absence of unnecessary payload downloads.
- [ ] Cancel copying and terminate the helper during copying, directory
  publication, shortcut/registry updates, and retained-copy cleanup. Restart the
  candidate and verify recovery without booting a stale disk.
- [ ] Try low space, a disconnected drive, an occupied destination, links,
  additional NTFS data streams, a pending update, and a running/orphaned guest.
  Errors must keep data intact and identify the remaining recovery action.
- [ ] Keep a second Settings window open during a move. It must neither save to
  the old location nor recreate removed files. Uninstall after cleanup, then
  reinstall from the downloaded candidate without stale redirects.
- [ ] Move an independent restored copy while another installation owns the
  default pointer. Its default selection and shortcuts must remain unchanged.
- [ ] Check Settings at the smallest supported display size and scaling, keyboard
  navigation, full-path visibility, progress, and cancellation.

## Hardware coverage

Track results for Intel and AMD CPUs, integrated and discrete Intel/AMD/NVIDIA
GPUs, Windows Home and Pro, and each advertised Windows version. Include a
physical system with full Hyper-V enabled and a lower-memory host. A nested VM
helps with automation but cannot replace physical GPU and hypervisor coverage.

The runtime-specific checks remain in [RUNTIME-VALIDATION.md](RUNTIME-VALIDATION.md).
