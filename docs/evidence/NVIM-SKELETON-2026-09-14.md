# Missing Neovim theme link in the factory skeleton, September 14, 2026

[#119](https://github.com/omacom/try-omarchy-windows/issues/119) tracks a missing
file the released `omarchy-nvim` package reports on the witness image:

```text
warning: omarchy-nvim: /etc/skel/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/theme.lua (No such file or directory)
omarchy-nvim: 10014 total files, 1 missing file
```

The investigation below identifies the cause, shows the user-visible effect, and
records the fix. It is separate from the duplicate command ownership that
[#116](https://github.com/omacom/try-omarchy-windows/issues/116) / #118 repaired.

## Cause

`omarchy-nvim` owns two copies of its Neovim defaults:

- `/etc/skel/.config/nvim`, installed into every new home by `useradd`, and
- `/usr/share/omarchy-nvim/config`, a fallback for older layouts.

The package's mtree shows that `/etc/skel` copy contains
`lua/plugins/theme.lua` as a symlink:

```text
./etc/skel/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/theme.lua type=link link=../../../../.local/state/omarchy/current/theme/neovim.lua
```

The `/usr/share/omarchy-nvim/config` copy intentionally omits it. That file is
generated per theme: `omarchy-theme-set-templates` renders
`default/themed/neovim.lua.tpl` into
`~/.local/state/omarchy/current/theme/neovim.lua`, and `omarchy-nvim-setup`
recreates the link with the same relative target.

The factory builder replaced `/etc/skel/.config` with the Omarchy source tree and
then rebuilt the Neovim skeleton from `/usr/share/omarchy-nvim/config` alone
(patch 0024). Because that directory has no `theme.lua`, the link disappeared from
the skeleton. Every account created from it, including the instant trial account,
opened Neovim without the active Omarchy theme, and `pacman -Qk` reported the
package file missing.

Read-only inspection of the checksum-verified v0.0.18 artifacts and the
compatibility-21 candidate confirms the link is absent from
`/etc/skel/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/` while the package database records it.

## Fix

`guest-build/0069` changes three things:

- `materialize-omarchy.sh` stashes the package's `/etc/skel/.config/nvim` before
  replacing `.config` and restores it afterward, so the packaged skeleton,
  symlink included, survives. It fails the build if the package skeleton is
  absent, rather than falling back to the package directory that lacks the link.
- `finalize-rootfs.sh` adds `etc/skel/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/theme.lua` to the
  compatibility overlay and bumps the revision to 22. Existing persistent disks
  regain the file when the launcher integration update runs.
- `catch-up` recreates the relative link for a user who has a packaged Neovim
  config but no `theme.lua`, using the same Omarchy-4 and Omarchy-3 theme
  locations as `omarchy-nvim-setup`. It never replaces a `theme.lua` that already
  exists, so a user's own file is left alone.

The contract tests cover the skeleton ordering, the overlay membership, the
revision, and the catch-up behavior, including leaving a user-written file in
place. `scripts/release/smoke-guest.py` gained `nvim-theme-skel`,
`nvim-theme-user` and `omarchy-nvim-files` facts, enabled from compatibility
revision 22, the first revision that carries the repair.

## Evidence

Local builder with the complete patch series applied: 117 guest tests pass (one
optional skip). While the facts were still enabled for revision 21, the pre-fix
compatibility-21 candidate was booted read-only with
`smoke-guest.py --compat-revision 21`; every previous fact passed and the new
facts failed exactly as expected:

```text
TRYOMARCHY_FACT:nvim-theme-skel:
TRYOMARCHY_FACT:nvim-theme-user:
TRYOMARCHY_FACT:omarchy-nvim-files:no
instant guest booted but the image facts are wrong: {'nvim-theme-skel': (None, 'yes'), 'nvim-theme-user': (None, 'yes'), 'omarchy-nvim-files': ('no', 'yes')}
```

The empty values are the earlier `test -L ... && case ...` command form, which
printed nothing when the link was absent; the shipped form prints `no`. The
shipped gate starts at revision 22, so a revision-22 image missing the link
still fails.

Log: `/home/bts/Projects/try-omarchy-evidence/issue119-prefix-smoke/prefix-candidate.log`
(SHA256 `068f2b2c6a5acfb16eaa629234f5e1096287f1e45dc0739f884d95b9f09e80c6`).
The booted disk was the pre-fix `issue116-candidate` image
(decompressed rootfs SHA256
`3537945357c088af347fc02c22c0febb8187c374f140ed4c2fbb988eaf8d50e6`); it was not
rebuilt, so this run demonstrates detection of the defect, not the repair.

## Factory build and boot

[CI run 34922457869](https://github.com/omacom/try-omarchy-windows/actions/runs/34922457869)
passed on branch commit `3005d89`, including the launcher and guest contract
jobs, the full locked factory build, and the headless instant-account boot. The
smoke reports the corrected facts:

```text
TRYOMARCHY_FACT:nvim-theme-skel:yes
TRYOMARCHY_FACT:nvim-theme-user:yes
TRYOMARCHY_FACT:omarchy-nvim-files:yes
```

All previous facts also pass, including `compat-version=yes` for revision 22,
`package-database=clean`, `runtime-package=4.0.3-4` and the Vulkan environment.

## Existing-guest delivery

`smoke-guest-upgrade.py` seeded a disposable copy of the checksum-verified
v0.0.18 image, then booted the rebuilt candidate and ran the normal updater. All
five phases passed: seed, upgrade, reboot, boot the old external image, and
return to the candidate. The strengthened fixtures assert the exact relative
target on the existing disk and in the instant account's home:

```text
:: Updating Try Omarchy launcher integration
try-omarchy-runtime: 2011 total files, 0 missing files
omarchy-nvim: 10014 total files, 0 missing files
+ expected_theme_link=../../../../.local/state/omarchy/current/theme/neovim.lua
++ readlink /etc/skel/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/theme.lua
++ readlink /home/omarchy/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/theme.lua
```

The revision-22 overlay put the link back on the existing disk and `catch-up`
restored the instant account's link. Database consistency, runtime `4.0.3-4`,
exclusive helper ownership, helper hashes, user files, installed packages and
the old-image rollback all still pass, so the delivery does not regress the
existing upgrade path. The published v18 assets are unchanged.
