# Releasing Try Omarchy

Releases use a two-phase GitHub Actions workflow so the signed launcher can pin
the guest manifest produced for that same release without rewriting source code
inside CI.

## One-time setup

The `release` GitHub environment is restricted to the `master` branch. Its
Azure application uses a repository-specific GitHub OIDC federated credential,
so no client secret is stored in GitHub.

The environment defines these variables:

- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`
- `AZURE_TENANT_ID`
- `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`
- `AZURE_SIGNING_ENDPOINT`
- `AZURE_SIGNING_ACCOUNT`
- `AZURE_SIGNING_PROFILE`

It also contains the `UPDATE_SIGNING_KEY` secret. This is the base64-encoded
PKCS#8 Ed25519 private key paired with `updatePublicKeyHex` in `app/update.go`.
The release job uses it only after Authenticode signing to authenticate the
small update manifest. Never store the private key in the repository.

The Azure application needs the `Artifact Signing Certificate Profile Signer`
role on the signing account. The workflow itself requests only `id-token: write`
and `contents: write` in the protected publish job.

The optional `signing-check` phase builds, signs, and verifies the current
launcher and signed update metadata without creating or modifying a release.
It requires the matching source pin and includes `test-update.json` in the
artifact for verification. Use it after changing the OIDC or signing configuration.

## Prepare the guest

1. Add the new version section to `CHANGELOG.md` and push it to `master`.
2. Run the `Release` workflow with phase `prepare` and the new preview tag.
3. The workflow applies the locked guest patches, runs the guest contract tests,
   rebuilds the image, boots the instant account headlessly, authenticates every
   artifact, and creates a draft release.
4. Download the draft `SHA256SUMS`, add it under `app/testdata`, and update
   `defaultReleaseURL`, `defaultSumsSHA256`, and the embedded fixture name in
   `app/manifest.go`. Update `currentVersion` in `app/update.go` and the numeric and text versions
   in `app/versioninfo.rc` to the same tag. Regenerate
   `app/rsrc_windows_amd64.syso` using the commands in `versioninfo.rc`.
5. Run `scripts/release/validate-pin.py TAG`, commit, and push the pin.

The pinned tag must be on `master` before `publish` runs: the workflow's guard
requires `refs/heads/master`, and the publish phase verifies that the source pin
matches the draft release manifest. This has one consequence worth expecting:
CI also runs `validate-pin.py --require-public` on every push to `master`, so
while the release is still a draft the "Validate current release pin" step fails
on `master`. That failure is correct, because a fresh build from `master` genuinely
cannot download the pinned assets yet. It clears as soon as `publish` makes the
release public. Do not merge a pin bump to an unpublished release through a pull
request; land it as the deliberate pre-publish step and publish promptly.

## Test the draft on physical Windows

A GitHub draft's assets require authentication, while the launcher downloads
without a GitHub token. Do not point the launcher directly at the draft URL.
After the manifest pin is pushed:

1. Run the `signing-check` phase on the pinned commit and download its signed
   launcher artifact.
2. Download every draft asset into one folder with an authenticated browser or
   `gh release download TAG --dir candidate-assets`.
3. Serve that folder over loopback on the test PC. For example, from the asset
   folder run `py -m http.server 18080 --bind 127.0.0.1`.
4. Close Try Omarchy and copy `%LOCALAPPDATA%\TryOmarchy` to a separate test
   directory. Never use the only copy of a real guest for candidate testing.
5. Start the signed candidate with the copied data directory and the local
   payload:

   ```powershell
   .\TryOmarchy.exe `
     -dir C:\TryOmarchyCandidate `
     -release http://127.0.0.1:18080 `
     -sums-sha256 SHA256SUMS_DIGEST `
     -runtime-release http://127.0.0.1:18080 `
     -runtime-sums-sha256 SHA256SUMS_DIGEST `
     -no-update
   ```

Confirm that the existing desktop and files survive, the new external kernel
boots, reboot and poweroff work, and a second launch does not repeat the guest
compatibility repair. For the rollback check, stop the first candidate boot
before userspace reports ready, then start the candidate again. The copied
install must restore its previous guest and runtime without downloading the
failed payload again.

Keep the release as a draft until the GPU, idle CPU, audio, input, resize, and
fullscreen checks in `docs/RUNTIME-VALIDATION.md` pass on physical hardware.

The guest builder base is fixed in `guest-build/source.lock.json`. The runtime
build inputs are fixed in `runtime-build/sources.lock.json`, and the Runtime
workflow produces matching portable and source archives with licenses,
provenance, and per-file hashes. Both archives used by a production release
stay fixed in `guest-build/runtime.lock.json`; update that lock only after the
new runtime passes `docs/RUNTIME-VALIDATION.md`.

## Publish

Run the `Release` workflow again with phase `publish` and the same tag. It:

- verifies that the source pin exactly matches the draft manifest;
- runs launcher tests and produces the optimized Windows build;
- signs through Azure Artifact Signing using GitHub OIDC;
- signs current update metadata with the protected Ed25519 update key;
- verifies Authenticode before upload;
- publishes without changing `Latest`;
- verifies the public tagged launcher, checksum, manifest, and guest URL through
  both the current repository and the original repository redirect;
- marks the release `Latest`, then verifies both repositories' `latest/download`
  paths, including the legacy and current signed update feeds.

If public verification fails, the release stays published but does not replace
the previous `Latest` release.

The updater accepts only a correctly signed manifest, a newer supported version,
the expected repository release URL, and matching SHA256 values. It stages the
launcher and payload directories atomically. Launcher, runtime, and guest
updates stay rollback-capable until the guest's userspace readiness service
reaches the launcher after networking starts, so QMP responding during a
kernel panic cannot commit a bad update. The writable disk is
preserved, and the updated initramfs installs the small matching launcher
integration onto disks created by older releases without replacing their OS or
user data.

## Moving from preview to stable

Ship and test a bridge preview containing the stable-version updater before
publishing v1. Set the release environment variable `LEGACY_UPDATE_BRIDGE_TAG`
to that published preview tag. Keep its launcher, payload, and signed metadata
available permanently. Stable publication refuses to proceed without verified
bridge metadata.

Each release carries two signed feeds:

- `update-v2.json` describes the current release and is used by the bridge and
  all newer launchers.
- `update.json` is for older launchers, which only accept preview tags. Preview
  releases use their own metadata; stable releases carry the original signed
  bridge metadata unchanged.

An old installation that misses the bridge still finds it through the stable
release's legacy feed. After installing the bridge, its next scheduled update
check uses the current feed and can install stable. The normal Latest launcher
link always serves the current executable. Signature verification, pinned
payload hashes, and rollback remain required at both steps.

Before v1, test an old preview against a candidate stable release with both
feeds, then verify bridge installation, stable installation, and forced
rollback on physical Windows with a copied guest disk. Also test a direct
stable download and a subsequent stable update. Automated tests cover feed
routing and recovery-state parsing, but do not replace these Windows checks.

Stable installations never automatically switch to a preview. The workflow
also prevents a later preview or older version from replacing a newer stable
Latest release. Retain the bridge feed on every future stable release so
infrequently used installations can still update.
